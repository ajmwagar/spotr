# SpotR: Spotify CLI Remote

## Design Principals

SpotR is designed to be a quick and easy remote for playing, pausing, and managing all things Spotify from the command line. 

Note: SpotR is not planned to actually handle playback. It simply serves as a way to quickly pause, play, etc. without switching windows or context switching.

Personally, my workflow usually takes place within SSH, so it's nice to be able to use this remotely.
